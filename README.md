# Assignment 3 MBTA Webapp by Martina and Carrie
## Project Overview
This project is a collaboration between Carrie and Martina. Its purpose is to create a web app that helps users to find the nearest MBTA station to the place they entered. In addition to the basic requirements, we added styles and pictures in the HTML templates using CSS. This made the program look nice and more user-friendly. Furthermore, we refined some of the functions in the mbta_helper.py to show a message if the user enters a location that is not covered by the MBTA (through try/except testing). We also added an index page before the webapp routing to the /mbta webpage.
## Project Reflection
### Process Overview
From a process point of view, the project went well. We successfully created the Python portion of the assignment in mbta_helper.py. Then we focused on getting the Flask part going. Finally, we spent time on the HTML templates to prettify the web app. We believe that the project was appropriately scoped and we had some room for self-learning on top of the required tasks. First, we took this opportunity to learn how to embed different fonts, styles and text sizes. Second, we added page colors, images, and boxes. Finally, we made the button prettier by including shadows, shapes and colors. We would use this knowledge for the final project as well. Making an interactive and user-friendly environment is important for app performance.
### Lessons Learned
However, we have ran into two major obstacles. One of them was when we input "Boston Common" as the location for testing purpose. It turns out there is Boston Common in Atlanta, Georgia. To fix it, we added an if-statement in the ```get_lat_long()``` function so that it returns the coordinates of the place that is actually in Massachusetts. We later on added another lines to return the coordinates for locations entered outside of Boston so that the code still runs even if the location entered is not within Boston.
Another issue was that in the original mbta_helper.py the first function would for input in the console. Instead it should have taken the input as part of the function arguments. We wish that we knew that earlier because Flask cannot use the function and return the nearest station with console input. Therefore, we had to rewrite the whole python file to fix it. One minor mistake that we made was incorrectly referring to the file mbta_form.html in the app. This resulted in failure to locate the template file. While this was a tiny detail, it caused us trouble running the program. Therefore, we would take these experiences in account when working on the final project.
### Teamwork
We worked as a real team and supported each other throughout the whole creation process. Initially, we split the tasks and Martina started writing the mbta_helper.py. However, Martina ran into a problem displaying the closest station so Carrie was able to look at it with a fresh pair of eyes and successfully fix the issues. Carrie also created the Flask app and Martina worked on the template designs. We are happy with the team work!
